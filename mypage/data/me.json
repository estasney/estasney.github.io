    "summary": "Experienced data analyst leveraging a diverse background, self-taught programming and relentless drive. I enjoy a dynamic environment with new problems. I split problems into their sub-components, apply what I know and seek out what I do not. \n\nI love working with Python! My core skill set is ETL. Very comfortable with Selenium, Requests, Pandas, and Jupyter Notebooks, to name a few.\n\nI have also enjoyed creating data-driven web applications, Chrome Extensions, and \"Kaggling\".\n\n \n\n\n",

        "Compiled, cleaned and made accessible a Company Name Disambiguation Python package. I found that 'in the wild' companies can have hundreds of name variants. This makes answering questions like, 'How many of X are from Y company?' extremely tedious. I used a directed graph data structure to represent a hierarchy of names where multiple uncommon names map to one common name."
